##  Selected topic 
Inflation of housing prices

### Reason why they selected their topic 
Inflation has caused prices to change significantly. With many people moving and selling houses, we would like to know if there are certain attributes that determine if a house sells above or below the listing price.

#### Description of their source of data 
Retrieving our data from Kaggle. The source consists of housing data from 2012-2021


##### Questions they hope to answer with the data
Does zipcode affect whether a house sells above or below the listing price?

Are there other factors that determine how a house sells?
